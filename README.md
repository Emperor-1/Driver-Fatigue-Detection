### Driver-Fatigue-Detection

By Shrihari

**Prevents the driver from falling asleep while driving.**

Camera installed inside the car processes the driver's face to detect the fatigue and prevents the driver from falling asleep on the wheel. The haar classifier face detection algorithm was implemented to process the driver's face which characterises the individual distinct objects. Raspberry Pi was used for hardware and OpenCV was used for face detection and processing.

*Hardware for processing : Raspberry Pi.
Built using Opencv Framework.*
